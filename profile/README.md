### 🎯 What is AiTweaking?

> **AiTweaking** is the underground art of shaping AI behavior without retraining or fine-tuning weights.

It’s where **prompt engineering**, **tool-calling logic**, and **agent memory manipulation** converge.  
A fusion of system prompt sorcery, autonomous agent design, and runtime orchestration.

You’re not building new AIs.  
You’re *tweaking* them to act like they were built for your purpose.

### 🧠 Core Beliefs

- **Model weights are sacred** — tweak everything else.
- **Prompting is programming.**
- **Autonomy needs orchestration.**
- **Aesthetics matter.**
- **Tweakers > Trainers.**

### 📜 Philosophy

> “You don’t need to be OpenAI to beat OpenAI.  
> You just need to tweak smarter.”
